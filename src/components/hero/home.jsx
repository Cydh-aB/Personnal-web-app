            <h1 className="text-4xl text-blue-500 mb-10">Hello !<br/> My name is Anthony Beral, i'm a junior web developer !</h1>
            <p>I always was interested in the web universe and the development in general, but for somes reasons i put away this part of me until last year.</p>
            <p>Good to know, i'm a very curious and creative person wich is the start of my professional turn-over, i think the web developement as a blank board with an infinite amount of possibility and evolution. It is in this sens that my personal goal in the long run is to become a Full Stack developer. That perspective puts me in a never ending learning approach and it's all i want for the future !</p>
            <p>All my previous professional experience has granted me something, notably on the character side such as :</p>
            <ul className="ml-[42%] mb-5">
                <li> - Curiosity</li>
                <li> - Autonomy</li>
                <li> - Reactivity</li>
                <li> - Fiability</li>
                <li> - Adaptability</li>
                <li> - Team work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm really looking forward for our future collaboration, i'm sure that i can bring something valuable to your company.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, i'm open to learning every technology who's necessary to do my job, so feel free to contact me even if it's not my "primary" specialisation.</p>
